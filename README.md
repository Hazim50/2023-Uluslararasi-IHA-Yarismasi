 I developed this application for 2023 Uluslararası İHA Competition. It contains locking and tracking unmanned aerical vehicle. I used PyQt5 to create an interface. I used dronekit to path planning and communication. I used QThread structure to manage parallel proccessing. It also gives opportunity to terminate thread when you want.

 Here, my code contains taking datas (video and telemetry datas) from CubePilot Herelink HD Video Transmission System
